**RoboCup Soccer Simulator Monitor** (rcssmonitor) is used to view the simulation as it takes place by connecting to the [RoboCup Soccer Simulator Server](https://github.com/rcsoccersim/rcssserver) (rcssserver) or to view the playback of a simulation by loading game log files.

## :soccer: Quick Start

rcssmonitor is implemented by C++14 and depends [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/).
At first, related tools have to be installed on the system.
In the case of Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04, execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential qt5-default libfontconfig1-dev libaudio-dev libxt-dev libglib2.0-dev libxi-dev libxrender-dev
```

Then, clone the repository. From its directory, execute commands:

```bash
./bootstrap
./configure
make
```

Alternatively you can download the tarball from the [releases section](https://github.com/rcsoccersim/rcssmonitor/releases), extract it and run from its contents:

```bash
tar xzvfp rcssmonitor-x.x.x.tar.gz
cd rcssmonitor-x.x.x
./configure
make
```

This will built the necessary binaries to get you up and running. `rcssmonitor/src/rcssmonitor` will be the binary for the monitor.

The version 16.0.0 or later support [CMake](https://cmake.org/). If CMake is prefered or problems with the above procedure, try the following commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

In this case, `rcssmonitor/build/rcssmonitor` will be the binary for the monitor.


## :hammer_and_wrench: Configuring & Building

Before building rcssmonitor you will need to run the `configure` script located in the root of the distribution directory.

The default configuration will set up to install the monitor components in the following location:

`/usr/local/bin` for the executables

You may need administrator privileges to install the monitor into the default location. This locations can be modified by using configure's `--prefix=DIR` and related options.  See `configure --help` for more details.
```bash
./configure --prefix=YOUR_INSTALLATION_DIR
```

The monitor has several features that can be enabled or disabled at configure time by using the `--enable-FEATURE[=ARG]` or `--disable-FEATURE` parameters to `configure`.  `--disable-FEATURE` is equivalent to `--enable-FEATURE=no` and `--enable-FEATURE` is equivlant to `--enable-FEATURE=yes`.  The only valid values for `ARG` are `yes` and `no`.

Once you have successfully configured the monitor, simply run `make` to build the sources.

If CMake is chosen, `ccmake` command is available for the configuration:

```bash
cd build
ccmake ..
```

## :package: Installing

When you have completed building the monitor, it's components can be installed into their default locations or the locations specified during configuring by running
```bash
make install
```
Depending on where you are installing the monitor, you may need special permissions.

## :wastebasket: Uninstalling
In the case of autotools, the monitor can also be easily removed by entering the distribution directory and running
```bash
make uninstall
```
This will remove all the files that where installed, but not any directories that were created during the installation process.

In the case of CMake, find `install_manifest.txt` under the build directory, then execute:
```bash
xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
```


## :play_or_pause_button: Using the Monitor

To start the monitor either type

```bash
./rcssmonitor
```

from the directory containing the executable or

```bash
rcssmonitor
```

If you invoke `rcssmonitor` with `--help` option, available options are displayed in your console.
