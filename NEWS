[9.3.2]
  * RCSSMonitor now will compile with either sstream or strstream,
    depending on which is available.

[9.2.0]
  * Added goal posts to the field.  Since they are quite small, they
  can only be view when zoomed in.

  * Fixed warnings with gcc3.2

[9.1.5]
  * Fixed minor compilation warning

[9.1.0]
  * supports new field layout for Keepaway.  The centerline and circle
  are removed.  A rectangular play region is drawn in the center of the
  field.  Use -m_keepaway 1 for this layout.  The length and width
  of the region can be specified using -m_keepaway_length and
  -m_keepaway_width.

  * Fixed crash on some machines

  * Fixed problems when compiling with gcc 3.2

[8.05]
  [rel_8]
  * Fixed compilation problem on systems without linux/joystick.h.  The
  configure script now checks for this header and only includes the joystick
  code if this header is available.

  [rel_6]
  * Fixed gcc3 compilation problems

  * supports new play modes (back_pass_l etc.)

  * supports more sophisticated drawing primitives now. You can send messages
  with up to 4096 bytes with drawing information for the rcssmonitor. The
  messages must begin with "_2D_ " (or "_2D_L " or "_2D_R ") and can be
  followed by several drawing commands.
  For example

    '_2D_ LINE col=ff0000 (0,20,40,20) (0,20,40,0); CIRCLE col=0000ff (0,0,20)
       (0,0,40); STRING (-20,0,"my_pos");'

  will draw 2 red lines, 2 blue circles and a string on top of the soccer
  field.

  Look into
  ascii_processor.C: AsciiProcessor::ins_obj(...)
  smonitor_dev.C:    SMonitorDevice::server_interpret_frameview_msg(...)
  for more details.
