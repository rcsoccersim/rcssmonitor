[19.0.0]
  * Support new server parameters.

  * Reimplement a rcg parser library. A faster JSON parser is now
    avaiable.

  * Fix warnings that occur with Qt-5.15

[18.0.0]
  * Support the changes of JSON-based protocol. To use the JSON-based
    monitor protocol, -1 is required for client-version.

  * Support the monitor protocol version 5 (RCG version 6).

  * Add options to draw the selected player's focus point.

[17.0.0]
  * Remove dependency on Boost library.

  * Support the monitor protocol version 5 (RCG version 6), which is a
    JSON-based format. The parser implemented at this time is quite
    slow, so the default client version is set to the previous one.

  * Reimplement the RCG parser library. The installation destination
    of the library header files has been unified under PREFIX/include/rcss.

[16.1.0]
  * Add a team graphic scaling option. Now, users can change the drawing
    scale of team graphic images.

[16.0.0]
  * Support new server specifications, illegal defense and fixed
    teamname. The monitor visualize the state of illegal defense
    detection by emphasizing detected players. Both fixed team name
    and real team name are displayed on the score board.

  * Integrate a log player feature. Now, rcssmonitor can be used
    instead of rcsslogplayer. The user can open a game log file(.rcg)
    from GUI menu or the command line option.

  * Add a time shift replay feature. Now, rcssmonitor can replay the
    simulation during the game without disconnecting from rcssserver.

  * Remove the buffering mode feature.

  * Change the default tool kit to Qt5. Qt4 is still available, but
    depricated.

  * Support CMake.

[15.2.1]
  * Fix a defect of Qt detection on Ubuntu 16.04.

[15.2.0]
  * Update m4 macro files for boost.

[15.1.1]
  * Fixed a locale bug. Thanks go to Sándor Nagy for reporting the
    detail and providing the patch.

[15.1.0]
  * Fixed a defect of boost detection by updating autoconf macros.

[15.0.0]
  * Supported new parameters of rcssserver-15.0.0.

[14.1.1]
  * Disabled QtOpenGL by default.

[14.1.0]
  * Added new command line options, "--auto-reconnect-mode" and
    "--auto-reconnect-wait". When auto-reconnect-mode is on, rcssmonitor
    will try to reconnect to rcssserver if rcssserver does not send
		information for auto-reconnect-wait(default:5) seconds. Note that
    auto-reconnect-mode overwrites auto-quit-mode. If
    auto-reconnect-mode is on, auto-quit-mode is always disabled.

  * Some parameters are renamed in '~/.rcssmonitor.conf'. It is highly
    recommended to delete the existing configuration file and
    regenerate new one.

  * Changed the policy of configuration file. Now, 'MainWindow' and
    'Monitor' sections in '~/.rcssmonitor.conf' are not updated by
    rcssmonitor. Users have to edit these values manually or set by
    command line options every time.

[14.0.1]
  * Changed the buffer recovering policy. Now, rcssmonitor tries to
    recover the buffer until filling up the default buffer size
    without advancing game status if the buffer becomes empty in
    the buffering mode.

  * Added a simple animation to show the buffer recovering status.

  * Fixed defects of default option value.

  * Fixed a bug of the red card action.

[14.0.0]
  * Reimplemented rcssmonitor using Qt4. Please note that Qt 4.3.0
    or later is required to build the new monitor. The new monitor
    supports the qmake build system. If you have troubles with
    Makefile generated by the configure script, please try
    'qmake && make'.

  * Supported QtOpenGL which render the data onto QGLWidget. If the
    performance is drastically decreased, please try
    `./configure --disable-gl' to disable QtOpenGL.

  * Supported Windows environment.

  * Supported new features in rcssserver version 14:
    - yellow/red card status.
    - new catch model.
    - foul success probability.
    - new heterogeneous parameters.

  * Supported buffering mode. Now, rcssmonitor can buffer packets from
    rcssserver and display them later. This feature will be useful
    under slow networks. But, note that rcssmonitor is still connected
    to rcssserver with UDP/IP connection. So, the buffering mode may
    not work successfully under unstable networks. This problem will
    be solved if TCP/IP is supported in the future version simulator.

   To enable buffering mode, you need to invoce rcssmonitor with the
   following option:

     $ rcssmonitor --buffering-mode on

   If you want to change the cache size(default value: 10), you need
   to add '--buffer-size' option to the command line:

     $ rcssmonitor --buffering-mode on --buffer-size 100

  * Added new interfaces for human referee:
    - playmode control.
    - yellow/red cards.

  * Almost all settings are written in ~/.rcssmonitor.conf (in Windows
    environment, this file is located under the working folder) with INI
    format. You can modify settings by editing this file.
